title:  "The Anatomy of Code"
---

Harkening back to the first few blog posts, we know that the language computers communicate in is machine language.  All code that we write as humans has to be compiled into binary so that the computer / device that is taking your instructions can execute them.

There are some basic building blocks to all programming languages. We've had an introduction to six of them so far: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C++, C# and Go.

Just like each spoken language has an alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and meanings to words, each one of these programming languages has the following building blocks:

- DATA TYPES - strings, numbers, boolean, arrays, objects(this)

- VARIABLE DECLARATIONS - `const`, `let`, `var`

- LOGICAL OPERATORS - &&, ||, !

- COMPARISON OPERATORS -  ==, ===, <, >, !=, !==, <=, >=

- CONDITIONAL STATEMENT / SWITCH STATEMENT - `if(){}else{}` / `switch(){ case }`, `break`, `default`, `continue`, `return`

- LOOPS - `for`, `while`

- FUNCTIONS - parameters, arguments, returns

- Other Methods: console.log(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce()

- OBJECTS, MAPS, STRUCTS, INTERFACES

- CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS / CLASSES

- CONCURRENCY

Over the next several posts I'll be breaking down each of these using the six languages I've previously introduced.

Happy coding!
