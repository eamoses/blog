title:  "Hello world continued"

In this installment of "Hello world" we'll be learning how to do this simple execution in both C++ and Go programming languages.

The reason I split this up into two parts is because JavaScript, Ruby and Python can all be interpreted.  C++ and Go are compiled. This means we have more overhead to get started with coding in C++ and Go, even to just print a simple "Hello world"
