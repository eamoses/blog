A "Hello world" program is known as the most basic program one can create in any programming language. In this post, I'm going to show you how to create a "Hello world" program in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C++ and Go.

<h1>Python</h1>

Python is an interpreted language, which means all we need to write a program in it is to download the lanugage and start up the interpreter.

We'll be using the Python interpreter in <i>interactive mode</i>, which means we'll be writing a single statement and the interpreter will be executing only that line.

First download Python3: [Scroll to the bottom and Click on your operating system][download-python]

Once it has installed, the folder name should be something like "Python 3.7" Now locate the program called IDLE within that folder and open it.

This should open the Python 3.7.3 Shell.

We start writing Python scripts after the > > > prompt.

Type the following:

<pre>>>> print("Hello world")</pre>

And press enter.

The string Hello world should have printed out.

Congratulations! You coded your first program in Python.

<h1>Ruby</h1>

You may already have Ruby installed on your computer. Depending on which operating system you're using, open your terminal emulator to check:

- macOS: open your Terminal application
- Linux: open up a shell
- Windows: open Command Prompt

And type `which Ruby`  If it gives you a path name such as /usr/bin/ruby, that means you already have Ruby installed. If it doesn't, that means you have to [install Ruby][download-ruby]

Now that we've confirmed we have Ruby, we can use IRB which stands for Interactive Ruby, similar to Python's IDLE.

For macOS and Linux users, simply type irb into your Terminal or shell. For Windows users, open Interactive Ruby from the Ruby section of your Start Menu.

Now type:
<pre>puts "Hello world"</pre>

`puts` is just like Python's `print()` statement

Congratulations! You've written your first program in Ruby!
