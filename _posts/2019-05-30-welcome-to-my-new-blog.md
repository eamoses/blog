Start-up Notes:

This is my first blog post using this framework, and others are free to grab this and use it to build out their own blogs as well. There are a few rules to go by as you build out your blog!

Once you've cloned [this repository]:

1. Youâ€™ll begin adding new posts in the `_posts` directory. 

2. In order to view live changes, run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server.

3. Every new post must follow the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and include the necessary front matter. Take note of this post and copy it until you remember the formula.

If you need to embed code, Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
