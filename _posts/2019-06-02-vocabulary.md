title:  "Vocabulary"
---

I'd never travel to an other country without learning the basic vocabulary of the host language, therefore I'd never begin teaching you to code without first giving you necessary words to navigate our new world.

This will become long as I add words and edit definitions, so it might be split up into two blog posts in the future!

- hardware
    - central processing unit (CPU) - microprocessors
    - main memory - RAM, random access memory
    - secondary storage devices - disk drives, solid state drives - external storage devices such as USB and external hard drives
    - input devices
    - output devices
- software
    - program
    - system software
    - application software
- binary: the only language a computer understands - machine language
    - 0s and 1s, on and off
    - bytes
    - bits, binary digit. 8 bits to 1 byte
    - ASCII
    - converting negative numbers and real numbers (floating point) to binary format
- CPU lifecycle
    - Fetch
    - Decode
    - Execute
- High Level Languages
    - Python
    - C++
    - Java
    - Ruby
    - JavaScript
- Low Level Languages
    - Assembly Languages: each brand of CPU (ex: IBM, Intel) has its own assembly language which is assembled into machine language
- Compilers and Interpreters
    - Compiled and interpreted programming languages
    - Dynamically typed and statically typed programming langauges
- Code Syntax
    - Syntax errors
- Program design
    - Source code
- Data types: The grammar of a programming language.
    - Basic Types
        - string
        - boolean (bool)
        - int8, uint8 (byte), int16, uint16, int32 (rune), uint32, int64, uint64, int, uint, uintptr
            - a `byte` is a built-in alias of uint8 and `rune` is a built-in alias of int32.
        - float32, float64
        - complex64, complex128
        - arrays
        - slices
        - maps
    - Composite Types
        - pointer: points to a place in memory, a reference.
        - struct
        - functions
        - channels
        - interfaces
- Strongly typed and weakly typed programming languages
