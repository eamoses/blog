    - Source code
- Data types: The grammar of a programming language.
    - Basic Types
        - string
        - boolean (bool)
        - int8, uint8 (byte), int16, uint16, int32 (rune), uint32, int64, uint64, int, uint, uintptr
            - a `byte` is a built-in alias of uint8 and `rune` is a built-in alias of int32.
        - float32, float64
        - complex64, complex128
        - arrays
        - slices
        - maps
    - Composite Types
        - pointer: points to a place in memory, a reference.
        - struct
