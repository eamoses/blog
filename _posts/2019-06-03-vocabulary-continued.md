    <summary>Code Syntax</summary>
    <br>
        Code syntax are a set of rules that must strictly be followed when writing a program. Syntax is language-specific. The syntax rules dictaet how key words, oeprators and various punctuation characters must be used in a program.

        <summary>Syntax errors</summary>
        <br>
            A syntax error is a mistake such as a misspelled key word, a missing punctuation character, or the incorrect use of an operator. Each programming language will have its own way of alerting the developer of a syntax error.

    <summary>Program Development Cycle</summary>
    <br>
        The steps to the development cycle of a software program:
        <br><br>
        - Design the program<br>
        - Write the tests<br>
        - Write the code to the tests<br>
        - Correct syntax errors<br>
        - Test the program<br>
        - Correct logic erros<br>

        <summary>Source code</summary>
        <br>
            The code that is written for a particular piece of software.

    <summary>Data types: The grammar of a programming language.</summary>
    <br>
        Basic Types: These type names are based on the Python programming language. These types may go by different names or behave differently in other programming languages, but this is an excellent place to start.

        Different data types take up different amounts of space in memory. Primitive data types such as numbers, single character strings, and booleans take up less space than object data (programmer-created data) such as lists, arrays, maps, functions, methods and so on.

    - `float`: decimal or floating point number
    - `set`
    - `frozenset`
    - `list`
    - `bytearray`: 2 dimensional arrays
    - `dict`: map or object
