title:  "Hello world: C++ and Go"
---

In this installment of "Hello world" we'll be learning how to do this simple execution in both C++ and Go programming languages.

The reason I split this up into two parts is because JavaScript, Ruby and Python can all be interpreted.  C++ and Go are compiled. This means we have more overhead to get started with coding in C++ and Go, even to just print a simple "Hello world"

<h1>C++</h1>

To compile and run our first C++ program, we have to make sure we have the compiler available. Type `gcc –version` or `gcc –v` into your terminal emulator. It should spit out what version your computer has.

If you don't have it, type the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential` for Windows and `xcode-select --install` for macOS.

There's slightly more overhead to run C++. We have to use a text editor. If you have a text editor already and know how to use it, continue with this tutorial. If you don't, read [this post about getting started with Visual Studio Code][vscode] first.
